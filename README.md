# chemical-inventory
chemical inventory repository with CRUD javascript functionality

The approach was to build the CRUD function using pure js while reading and loading the table using the JSON file as the data is fetched mostly through the APIs. The main challenge was to make a save to the JSON file but due to browser restrictions only download option is implemented as JSON file.
